# CodeRisk Agent — Project Specification

> AMD AI DevMaster Hackathon | Track 2: Agentic AI
> Team: Yang Weike (Solo Developer)

## 1. Executive Summary

**CodeRisk Agent** is an AI-powered code security analysis system that runs entirely on local AMD Radeon GPUs. It combines multiple specialized AI agents with traditional static analysis tools to detect, verify, and report software vulnerabilities — without sending source code to any external service.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Multi-Agent architecture with 4 specialized agents + orchestrator
- Triple cross-validation with self-reflection loop
- Dual memory system (correct patterns + false positive suppression)
- Local CVE database (pre-downloaded from NVD)
- Full local execution on AMD GPU — code never leaves the machine

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Enterprise Code Security Dilemma

Modern enterprises face a critical tension: they need AI-powered code security analysis, but they cannot upload their source code to cloud services.

**Why code can't go to the cloud:**
- **Compliance:** HIPAA, GDPR, classified systems require data residency
- **Intellectual Property:** Core algorithms are trade secrets
- **Supply Chain Security:** Third-party code under NDA cannot be shared
- **Corporate Policy:** Samsung, Apple, Amazon, and JP Morgan have all banned cloud AI for code

**The scale of the problem:**
- 25,000+ new CVEs published annually (2025 data)
- 67% of enterprises express concern about AI code tool data security (Gartner, 2024)
- Average cost of a data breach: $4.88 million (IBM, 2024)

**The gap:** Existing tools like Semgrep find known patterns but miss logic vulnerabilities. Cloud AI understands code but requires uploading it. There is no solution that combines deep AI analysis with local-only execution.

### Comparison with Existing Tools

| Capability | Semgrep | Snyk | CodeQL | GitHub Copilot | **CodeRisk Agent** |
|------------|---------|------|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| Local execution | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| LLM semantic analysis | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| CVE/NVD integration | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (local SQLite) |
| Self-learning memory | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (dual memory) |
| Triple cross-validation | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Evidence chain | Pattern | Pattern | Pattern | Black box | **Full traceability** |
| Privacy | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| GPU acceleration | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A | ✅ (ROCm/HIP) |

**Key differentiator:** CodeRisk Agent is the only tool that combines LLM-powered semantic analysis with local-only execution and a self-learning memory system. Existing tools are either local-but-shallow (Semgrep, CodeQL) or smart-but-cloud (Snyk, Copilot).

## 5. ROCm Optimization

### 5.1 GPU Environment

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| GPU | AMD Radeon Pro W7900 (RDNA 3) |
| ROCm | 7.2.4 |
| HIP | 7.2.53211 |
| Platform | Radeon Cloud container |

### 5.2 Key Discovery

The llama.cpp build system changed the HIP backend flag:
- **Old (2024-2025):** `GGML_HIPBLAS=ON`
- **New (2026):** `GGML_HIP=ON`

This was the root cause of initial GPU inference failures — not container virtualization limitations.

### 5.3 Build Command

```bash
ROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm-7.2.4 cmake -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DLLAMA_BUILD_SERVER=ON
cmake --build build --config Release -j$(nproc)
```

### 5.4 Performance Results

| Metric | CPU | GPU (HIP) | Improvement |
|--------|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Token generation | 6.8 t/s | 105 t/s | **15.4×** |
| Prompt processing | — | 628 t/s | — |
| VRAM usage | — | 41% (~19.6 GB) | — |
| GPU temperature | — | 26°C | — |

> All performance data was measured on our Radeon Cloud instance
> (Pro W7900, ROCm 7.2.4, HIP backend).

### 5.5 Optimization Strategies

| Layer | Strategy | Expected Impact |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Model | Q4_K_M quantization |19.6 GB VRAM, fast inference |
| Model | Flash Attention (`-fa 1`) |Expected 30-50% latency reduction (not measured separately) |
| Task | Agent 1 on CPU, Agent 2/3 on GPU | Maximum GPU utilization |
| System | HIP backend |15× vs CPU |
| System | Continuous batching (future optimization) |3-5× throughput (future) |

## 6. Testing & Validation

### 6.1 Unit Tests

- 51 pytest tests, all passing
- Coverage: Buffer overflow, command injection, code injection, deserialization, safe code

### 6.2 End-to-End Test (Radeon Cloud)

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Agent 1: Static | ✅ |5 files, 18 risks |
| Agent 2: LLM | ✅ |10 calls, 11,362 tokens |
| Agent 3: Verifier | ✅ |4 missed risks found, 1 false positive suppressed |
| Agent 4: Report | ✅ | JSON + Markdown + Terminal |
| Memory Layer | ✅ |17 patterns recalled |
| CVE Client | ✅ | Local SQLite queries successful |

**Total:**47-48 risks detected in 18 minutes (including GPU inference)

### 6.3 CVE Validation

Real CVE data from local SQLite database (pre-downloaded from NVD):
- CVE-1999-0046 (Buffer overflow, CVSS 10.0)
- CVE-1999-0067 (Command injection, CVSS 10.0)
- CVE-2003-0791 (Deserialization, CVSS 9.8)
- CVE-2002-0159 (Format string, CVSS 7.5)

### 6.4 Real-World Detection Results

CodeRisk Agent was validated against live targets to confirm real-world detection capability:

| Target | Finding | Verification | Status |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| testasp.vulnweb.com | SQL Injection (boolean-based blind) | Manual confirmation with crafted payloads | ✅ Confirmed |
| testasp.vulnweb.com | XSS (reflected) | Payload reflected in response | ✅ Confirmed |
| jxnu.edu.cn | SVN repository exposure (.svn/entries) | Directory listing accessible | ⚠️ Temporarily exposed, later 404 |
| demo.testfire.net | Known vulnerable test app | Full pipeline scan | ✅ All agents operational |

**Key insight:** The SQLi detection on testasp.vulnweb.com validated the entire Agent 1→2→3 pipeline — Agent 1 flagged the pattern, Agent 2 confirmed via LLM analysis, Agent 3 cross-referenced with CVE data. This is not a synthetic test case; it is a real-world vulnerable target from the OWASP Vulnerable Web Applications Directory.

### Planned Features

| Feature | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Java support | P1 | 15+ rules targeting OWASP Top 10 Java patterns |
| Go support | P1 | Goroutine concurrency issue detection |
| Rust support | P2 | Unsafe block analysis |
| Cross-function taint analysis | P2 | Call graph construction for multi-function data flow |
| LLM batch processing | P2 | Batch small files into single LLM call (50-70% fewer calls) |
| Web UI | P3 | Browser-based code upload and report viewing |
| IDE plugin | P3 | VS Code / JetBrains integration |
| CI/CD integration | P3 | GitHub Actions for automated scanning |

### Scope Decision

Language coverage (C + Python) was a deliberate scope decision: **deep rule quality over shallow multi-language coverage**. Each language receives the same depth of rules (13-14 per language) and full semantic analysis before release. This ensures that CodeRisk Agent provides production-grade detection for supported languages rather than superficial coverage of many languages.
